## Version control and issues

Issues are tracked with [beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) (`bd`).
For version control, use git or [jj](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/), whichever
you prefer. Coding agents always use jj.

### Setup, once per clone

```sh
git clone <url>           # or: jj git clone <url>
bd bootstrap              # fetch the issue database; never `bd init`
```

To use jj in a git clone, run `jj git init --colocate` in it.

Issues live in a database under `.beads/`, not in commits, and travel through
the same remote on a ref of their own. `bd sync` pulls and pushes them. Run it
before you start and after you change an issue.

### Working on an issue

```sh
bd sync
bd ready                  # pick something unblocked
bd update <id> --claim
# make one commit (or jj change) for the issue,
# with a message that starts with "<id>: "
bd close <id>
bd sync
```

Then push a branch and open a pull request: `git push -u origin <branch>`, or
`jj git push --change @` with jj.
